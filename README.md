# PlasmaFractal
Old-school plasma fractal with palette animation effect running in a browser. Pure JavaScript, no WebGL.

Basic algorithm:
- Grayscale image is generated once using Perlin Noise algorithm (multiple iterations per pixel to produce fractal).
- For each frame:
  - Palette is animated by rotating the palette entries and by blending between random colors.
  - Grayscale image is mapped to RGB by using pixel values as palette indices.

## [Live demo](https://zett42.github.io/PlasmaFractal/)
- Single-click to randomize fractal.
- Double-click to toggle fullscreen.
- Press the "gear" button in the top-left corner to adjust plasma parameters and palette.
- Tested with Chrome 76.0.3809.100 and Firefox 68.0.2 (seems to run smoother in Chrome).

### Experimental Versions
- [**NoiseTransitions Demo**](https://zett42.github.io/PlasmaFractal/experimental/NoiseTransition/index.html)
  - Renders two differently seeded plasma fractals in separate threads ([Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)) and cross-fades between them to generate ever-changing structures (see Options > Animation > Noise Transition).
  - Requires [Offscreen Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas) (experimental API) support by browser.
  - Tested successfully with Chrome 76.0.3809.100, but fails with Firefox 68.0.2 (it is [missing 2D-OffscreenCanvas support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=801176)).
